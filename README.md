# hugokat.dev

## Overview
Hey there! This is the repository for my [portfolio website](https://hugokat.dev/). I designed and prototyped the website in [Figma](https://hugokat.dev/) using the [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/). I built the website using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with a [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) backend. Finally, I deployed the website using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/hugo-kats-projects) and [Pockethost](https://pockethost.io/).

## Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation)
- [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) and [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/pocketbase/js-sdk)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install/)
- [SWR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)

## How to run
TODO: EXPLAIN HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT
e.g. `yarn run dev` to run it locally
e.g. create `.env` file with connections to the pocketbase database.

## Assets
