# Portfolio 

## Overview
This is my personal website made using Vite, React, and TypeScript

## Dependencies
- Node
- NextJS
- SaSS
- Next Fonts

## Assets
The icons used in this website were retrieved from the following sites: [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/), [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/), and [Icon Icons](https://icon-icons.com/). Each icon has a corresponding attribution if needed. 

The website used the [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

The website uses the [Nord Theme](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes) colour palette.

The website uses the [Inter font](https://rsms.me/inter/).

A [Codepen filter generator](https://codepen.io/sosuke/pen/Pjoqqp) was used to create filters to colour the SVG icons.

## Look into?

Use PocketBase as the database???
Environment variables for API stuff

1. Style React components using external frameworks (e.g. tailwind) or preprocessors such as SaaS
2. Extend the project to use Next.JS?
3. What is yarn used for?
4. Look into deployments (see Brittany's GitHub). Like what is she deploying?
5. Why is GitHub not identifying my language?
6. What is React Router?
7. What is CodePen?
8. What is fluent UI?

## TODO
1. Decide how I want to design my website (e.g. using FIGMA)
2. Design the website
3. Deploy the website using GitHub pages
4. Add Blog section - with backend - first Blog can be about making the Blog section
