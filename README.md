# Portfolio 

## Overview
This is my personal website made using Vite, React, and TypeScript

## Inspiration
1. Brittany Chiang: https://brittanychiang.com/
2. Tobias Ahlin: https://tobiasahlin.com
3. Cassie Evans: https://www.cassie.codes/
4. Amie Chen: https://amie-chen.com/

## Look into?
1. What is yarn used for?
2. Look into deployments (see Brittany's GitHub). Like what is she deploying?
3. Why is GitHub not identifying my language?
4. What is React Router?

## TODO
1. Decide how I want to design my website (e.g. using FIGMA)
2. Design the website
3. Deploy the website using GitHub pages
