## Look into?
1. Style React components using external frameworks (e.g. tailwind) or preprocessors such as SaaS
2. Extend the project to use Next.JS?
3. What is yarn used for?
4. Look into deployments (see Brittany's GitHub). Like what is she deploying?
5. Why is GitHub not identifying my language?
6. What is React Router?
7. What is CodePen?
8. What is fluent UI?

## TODO
1. Decide how I want to design my website (e.g. using FIGMA)
2. Design the website
3. Deploy the website using GitHub pages
4. Add Blog section - with backend - first Blog can be about making the Blog section
