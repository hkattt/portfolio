        Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on and an overview of my technical interests.

        <br /><br />

        Through my studies, I’ve developed a strong foundation in computer systems and cyber security. What I enjoy most about
        these areas is understanding how computers work on a nitty-gritty level.

        <br /> <br />

        Outside of my formal studies, I continue to expand my technical skills. For example, I taught myself web development
        because I needed a way to showcase my work.

        <br /> <br />

        More recently, I’ve been getting into game development through game jams. What started as a silly curiosity has
        slowly become my greatest passion because it allows me to express my technical skills in a creative way.
