        Here are some of the projects I’ve worked on and an overview of my technical interests.

        <br /><br />

        Through my studies, I’ve developed a strong foundation in computer systems and cyber security. What I enjoy most about
        these areas is understanding how computers work on a nitty-gritty level.

        <br /> <br />

        Outside the classroom, I am still a total nerd - I cannot stop myself from exploring other technical areas. I taught
        myself web development because I needed a place to showcase my work.

        <br /> <br />

        More recently, I’ve been getting into game development through game jams. What started as a silly curiosity has
        slowly become my greatest passion because it use my technical skills in a creative way.
